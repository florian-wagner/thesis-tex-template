# thesis-tex-template

This is the LaTeX template of [my PhD thesis](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/116422/eth-49006-02.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y). It is not an official ETH Zurich template, but is frequently used within the Institute of Geophysics at the Department of Earth Sciences. It might be useful for others as well. Feel free to use it for your purpose and consider adding yourself to the table below.
